# Hand Gesture Recognition for Volume Control

This project implements hand landmark detection, tracking, determining left or right hand, angle detection between fingers, and device (Mac) volume control through hand gestures. The implementation is based on the `mediapipe` and `opencv` libraries, along with other necessary Python libraries.

## Features

- Hand Landmark Detection: Identifies key points on the hand.
- Hand Tracking: Tracks hand movement in real-time.
- Left/Right Hand Detection: Determines whether the detected hand is left or right.
- Finger Angle Detection: Measures the angle between fingers.
- Volume Control: Adjusts the device volume using hand gestures.
